Nan: There's a lot of things to consider. I say this with completely honesty, right? We have a lot of respect for what Atlassian has done over the course of that company's lifetime. They effectively built out this particular space, right?

Jira is like a de facto standard for a lot of people's experience. And no one ever got fired for installing Jira, right? With any kind of incumbent like that, like they're always going to look like they have a sort of market dominant position.

And I think it's been tempting for a lot of startups to try to compete with Jira, right? If you ask engineers on the ground, the app it's starting to show its age. I don't know exactly what their NPS is, but if you look at an incumbent with a big market cap with relatively low NPS amongst day-to-day users, it's appealing for a certain kind of business to want to try to figure a way in or try to figure out, is there something new we can do in this space?
